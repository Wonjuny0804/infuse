## This is the rules to follow! or YOU WILL BE FIRED!

1. ALWAYS give me 2 implementation plans
2. If I choose an implementation plan turn it into a multi-step plan .md file with checkboxes
3. RUN TESTS BEFORE SHOWING ME THE CODE OR YOU WILL BE FIRED.
4. Code should always be concise and easy to read and understand, decoupled with each other.

Please use the task-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from my PRD. The PRD is located at scripts/prd.txt.
